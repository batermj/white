White: Black, but White instead (PEP8–inspired)
===============================================

`Black <https://github.com/ambv/black>`_ is an amazing tool for auto–formatting
Python code in a style that I prefer. I use it in all my projects.

It is configurable, however, to change it's default line–length of ``88``
charecters to, say, ``79``, like PEP8 recommends.

That is exactly what this tool does. It invokes ``$ black --line-length 79`` on your behalf.

Installation
============
